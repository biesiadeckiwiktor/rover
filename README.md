# Mars rover project
The primary goal of this project is to apply and integrate concepts learned throughout my course while expanding my knowledge in computer science, robotics and AI. This project serves as both a practical application of theoretical knowledge and a platform for exploring advanced topics beyond the standard curriculum. I chose to build a mars rover as a base, as would allow me to merge designing body, choosing and integrating correct hardware and improving my programming skills with Raspberry Pi and Arduino. This design also allows to implement gradual improvements over time expanding on its funcionality.
